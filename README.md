I am a first-year MURP student concentrating in Design and Development. I enjoy doing design work for planning projects and would like to learn how to make maps and visualize data beter. Through this course, I am hoping to gain skills in GIS through the use of code in order to add layers of data that better inform viewers on specific urban issues. I would also like to learn how to merge the maps that are coded with design that can be done on the Adobe suite for better story-telling. I am interested in climate resilience as well as mobility, so I will likely work on a project that focuses on those issues.
