# Profile

My name is Mariana Estrada and my pronouns are she/her. I am a first-year MURP student concentrating in Design and Development. I grew up in Boyle Heights for most of my life and then moved to Perris, a small city in the Inland Empire. I currently live in K-town. 

# Course Description and Personal Objectives

Students will gain skills in geographic information systems in order to visualize data relating to urban issues in a compelling manner.

I enjoy doing design work for planning projects and would like to learn how to make maps and visualize data beter. Through this course, I am hoping to gain skills in GIS through the use of code in order to add layers of data that better inform viewers on specific urban issues. I would also like to learn how to merge the maps that are coded with design that can be done on the Adobe suite for better story-telling.
